# TruffleBucket
An AWS version to sniff for secrets from Public or Private S3 buckets

[Credit](https://github.com/dxa4481/truffleHog) goes to Trufflehog repository who inspired the development of this tool to be used in a Cloud related use-case.

Currently this is only for development of AWS for scanning exposed or internally private accesible storage blobs (S3).
